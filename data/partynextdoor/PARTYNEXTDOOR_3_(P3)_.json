now\nShit just got real, things are gettin' intense now\nI hear you talkin' 'bout \"We\" a lot, oh, you speak French now?\nGiving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now\nI hit you up like \"Do you wanna hang right now?\"\nOn the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now\nYou say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now\nIt's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now\nAll she talkin' bout is, \"Come and see me for once\nCome and see me for once\nYou don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\"\nAll she ever say is, \"Come and see me for once\nCome and see me for once\nYou don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\"\nI been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'\nThumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong\nI'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry\nThings change, people change, feelings change too\nNever thought the circumstances woulda changed you\nYou said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)\nAnd I believed you when they told me don't\n(Yeah, I thought you meant that)\nBut either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you\n"}, {"title": "Nothing Easy to
