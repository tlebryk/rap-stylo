I'm literally killing everything\nI hit my connect and sometimes he don't hit me back\nWhen I find a new plug I guarantee that's just to rap\nDon't forget to ask, that energy is right where you left it at\nOh they want me dead and gone? I'm just not accepting that\nNo sir, I got my own plans that involve bands and me gettin' that\nMaking something out of nothing, turns out I'm the best at that\nI got a new thesis, Tear da Club Up, Three 6\nMake it fly like G6, tryna find a million like Kanye found Jesus\nBe thankful, it's not too much I can't do, yeah\n\n"}]
