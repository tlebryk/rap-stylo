could thank me now\nMahalo from the hardest act to follow\nLately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle\nAlohas to women with no ties to men\nThat I know well, that way there are no lies\nYou can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas\nI'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas\nI guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas\nI must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas\nIt's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating\nYou got your resolutions, we just got reservations\nLiving out a dream it feels like I stayed up\nAnd we just want to party, Patron straight up\nFuck that old shit, I'm on new things\nOVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang\nYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\nWho would have thought the route we'd chosen\nWould ever end up this scenic?\nI can relate to kids going straight to the league\nWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed\nAnd that's around the time\nThat your idols become your rivals\nYou make friends with Mike\nBut got to A.I. him for your survival\nDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous\nCause we want to be them, and they want to be us\nSo on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment\nThat you take for granted, you can thank me now\nAnd oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome\nAt this point me is who I am trying to save myself from\nRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\nCause they think that I can help them\nGet back to where they fell from\nBut drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight\nExcept the niggas that I came with, they good for life\nThat's how you know it's going down\nIn case another chance never comes around\nYou could thank me now, go 'head\nThank me later, yeah I know what I said\nBut later doesn't always come so instead\nIt's okay, you could thank me now\nShallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming\nI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\nI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\nCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic\nMan, the good girls went silent on me\nThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\nAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\nThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me\nBut do I ever come up in discussion\nOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?\nDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\nI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson\nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\nWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes\nThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul\nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\nThat are ready to get married at hello\nBecause of what they allowed, where are they all now?\nI know they're somewhere watching\nSo I'm trying to make them proud\nSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me\nThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see\nI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?\nThey say the doors will open up\nSoon as you find the missing key\nThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining\nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment\nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded\nAnd the bandwagon's full\nBut you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry\nPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds\nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town\nI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown\nAnd I know life is just a game\nIn which the cards are facing down\nI'm in a world where things are taken, never given\nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\nAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\nSo while I'm still here in this position\nYou could thank me now, go 'head\nThank me later, yeah I know what I said\nBut later doesn't always come so instead\nIt's okay, you could thank me now\n\n"}, {"title": "9AM in Dallas", "year": "2010", "album": "Thank Me Later ", "writers": ["drake"], "artist": "drake", "lyrics": "These are my One St. Thomas flows\nMe, my niggas and some Madonna hoes\nThat look just like virgins but trust they down to go\nDiscussing life and all our common goals\nSmart kids that smoke weed, honor roll\nLook how the champagne diamonds glow\nFine dining pour another glass when the wine is low\nI'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling\nWhatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing\nThese other rappers getting that inferior feeling\nI hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing\nTake a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing\nIf you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant\nPeople ask how music is going, I heard it pays\nI just came off making two million in 30 days\nDamn, \"I guess it does\" is what the message was\nSometimes I feel I be spending my money just because\nWith Weezy I'm just out here repping us\n'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us\nYeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics\nKush got the room smelling like teen spirit\nI ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up\nUntil I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader\nI fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up\nAnd book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up\nWho you like, tell me who it is\nI'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list\nI should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist\nThis one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss\nWithout a response from me you really fail to exist\nAnd I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit\nI swear, pussy nigga get your bread up\nEnjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up\nWhy your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up\nNo one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?\nWith nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up\nSo you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah\nI try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff\nChase N.
