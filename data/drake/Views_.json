there is beyond me\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nHow do you not check on me when things go wrong\nGuess I should've tried to keep my family closer\nMuch closer\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nGuess that's what they say you need family for\nCause I can't depend on you anymore\nAlways saw you for what you could've been\nEver since you met me\nLike when Chrysler made that one car\nThat looked just like the Bentley\nI always saw you for what you could've been\nAnd even when it's business with you it's personal again\nI knew you before you made ends meet\nAnd now we're meeting our end\nAnd it's all because you chose a side\nYou're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me\nGuess it wasn't time (yeah)\nAnd of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine\nYou're so predictable I hate people like you\nKennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you\nHow you supposed to figure out what I'm going through\nYou can't even figure out what's going on with you\nYou judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures\nI make all the player's anthems for the real niggas\nWith my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong\nOut here in L.A., I don't know what's going on\nI don't know what's going on\nAnd it's all because you chose a side\nYou're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me\nGuess it wasn't time (yeah)\nAnd of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine\nYou sit and you pray hoping that the stars align\nMy luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right\nWhen I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice\nBut you always had something to say every other time\nEverybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way\nI'm fooding and serving them all\nLike I'm working for minimum wage\nSomeone up there must just love testing my patience\nSomeone up there must be in need of some entertainment\nForgiveness for your ways\nIf I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised\nSame way I'm right here still feeling the way\nSame way I'm realizing on a day to day that\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nHow do you not check on me when things go wrong\nGuess I should've tried to keep my family closer\nMuch closer\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nGuess that's what they say you need your family for\nCause I can't depend on you anymore\nMuch closer\n"}, {"title": "9", "year": "2016", "album": "Views ", "writers": ["david harrisingh", "serani", "craig harrisingh", "drake"],
