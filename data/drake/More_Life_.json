time they wanna take my place\nWhole time they wanna take my place\nWhole time they wanna take my place\nYeah, I know they wanna take my place\nI can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)\nI don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)\nHow you wanna clique up after your mistakes?\n(That's just what I heard)\nLook you in the face, and it's just not the same\nI've been down so long, it look like up to me\nThey look up to me\nI got fake people showin' fake love to me\nStraight up to my face, straight up to my face\nI've been down so long, it look like up to me\nThey look up to me\nI got fake people showin' fake love to me\nStraight up to my face, straight up to my face\nSkrrt\nAnd more chune for your headtop\nSo watch how you speak on my name, you know?\n\n"},

anyone but me (yeah)\nPatient as can be, but\nI still need some satisfaction\nA little less talk and a little more action\nI need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'\nThought I had everything, somehow\nI wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there (takin' it)\nI want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera (in a 911)\nSee you when I see the real thing, gettin' realer and realer (real)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nBut you icy like 1017 (icy)\nIcy like there's nobody you'd ever need (icy, icy)\nBetter not give that up (better not give that up)\nI'm here patient as can be, man\nI still need some

still want problems though\nAll the things I know, I still been silent though\nYeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo\nUsed to be in lunchroom, playin\u2019 dominoes\nI don't want to have to go to funerals\nI gotta start sleepin' at the studio\nI don't have no time to be no Romeo\nAll the love I need is at the rodeo\nAll the love I need is here at OVO, yeah\nAll the girls I know are there with E and Tho\nWho knows where I end up when that shit gets old?\nMaybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes\nLast table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone\nI take a glass of Domina to go with me home\nMight move our annual shit to the 'Dome\nI need 40,000 people to see what I'm on\nYeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves\nI was an angry yute when I was writin\u2019 Views\nSaw a side of myself that I just never knew\nI\u2019ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do\nSteady doin' double shifts\n1da doin\u2019 the beat and I open up like a double click\nMore blessings because I'm generous\nThirty-seater plane for like ten of us\nRemember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet\nShe knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it\nNowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it\nCan't describe what my life is like when she asks about it\nScary whenever I close my eyes at night\nWakin\u2019 up to public statements about my private life\nI can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights\nBut you can rest assured that my mind is right\nGet no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days\nNever stick around to see shit change\nGet lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'\nSeasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'\nWent from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV\nTo not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'\nI can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this\nDistractions will do you in, in the truest sense\nEspecially people that want to lecture me\nAnd frame it like they just want the best for me\nOr they check for me, whatever splits it up\nSo there's more for them and there's less for me\nThey don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me\nNo one's done it successfully\n7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me\nLast verse that I gotta do is always like surgery\nAlways tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me\nThat's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency\nLast chance I get to make sure that you take it personally\nTake this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly\nIf we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me\nYou overnight celebrity, you one day star\nSwear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity\nI am a reflection of all of your insecurities\nBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping\nDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me\nThere's real ones around me\nI want to make sure they learn from me\nI want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety\nHe can't even dip out to see me in an emergency\nMy life is centered 'round competition and currency\nTakin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery\nMaybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me\nI'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary\nMore Life\n\n"}, {"title": "More Life [Note]", "year": "2017", "album": "More Life ", "writers": ["drake"], "artist": "drake",
