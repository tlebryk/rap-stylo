mine\nMarcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times\nHe took over like four years ago when Courtne had resigned\nI been talkin' sex with Courtne since like 2005\nWe been friends since junior high\nTough to enjoy the company and never cross the line\nShe's like, \"Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?\"\nAnd I say, \"Yeah, that's bein' kind\"\nAt one point or another they all felt like they were mine\nI had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind\nI'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time\nI like when it's you and I\nPlus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you\nThat could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides\nUnless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side\nIt's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide\nLessons that I learned before hittin' my prime\nConfessions that I blame on the zodiac sign\nThings you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes\nFree myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise\nYeah\n"}, {"title": "In the Cut", "year": "2020", "album": "Certified Lover Boy ", "writers": ["drake"], "artist": "drake", "lyrics": "Ayy, yeah\nPipe this shit up and I turn this shit up\nWhen
