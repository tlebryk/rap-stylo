what's different from that guy and the richer me\nThe only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany\nAnd some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany\nReally, that's it to me\nAside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery\nTestin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery\nThey say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be\nThe boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie\nEthics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned\nMonopoly action\nBronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron\nA lot of pain, a lot of passion\nA lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'\nThat's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson\nThat's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'\nLast year, niggas really feel like they rode on me\nLast year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me\nI'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me\nI'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me\nYeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only\nChampagne popper, the love doctor\nYour baby mother call me when she lonely\nMy tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie\nForever grateful, forever thankful\nDiamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle\nThe bitch is trendy\nMy enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me\nI'm bankin' two million a show for the residency\nNevada gaming commission in a frenzy\nHow much money can this casino lend me?\nRippin' markers up over shots of the Henny\nVivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?\nTo me, Benihana is pigeon food\nThis not a forgivin' mood\nSo much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room\nI am just a body that my brothers are livin' through\nKeepin' my connections strictly physical\nEveryone that's married is miserable\nI know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into\nThe rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical\nI don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital\nIt's the American Expresser, the debt collector\nHailin' all the way from the Mecca\nGot something for Trudy and Rebecca\nThis shit could last forever\nThe mind controller, the Ayatollah\nI built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over\nStep in the room and October gets a lot closer\nHaunted houses\nI don't know how to count in thousands, only millions\nNow tell your friends I'm not the villain\nSend 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos\nBarbados, Trinidad and Tobago\nNever go the same places they go\nSeparate vacations\nA far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement\nI was never on the path to get into Cambridge\nI mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language\nBorderline dangerous, approach with caution\nI plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction\nMan, truth be told, I think about it often\nThe petty king, the overseer of many things\nI wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings\nI wouldn't have space on either hand for anything\nWest Hollywood, know my presence is menacing\nCosa Nostra, shady dealings\nRacketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things\nThe things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling\nBut no regrets, though, the name'll echo\nYears later, none greater\nDeath to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah\n\n"}, {"title": "Money in the Grave", "year": "2019", "album": "The Best

really even start?\nI got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark\nI got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large\nThinkin' back to the fact that they dead\nThought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars\nI got two phones, one need a charge\nYeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart\nI got big packs comin' on the way\nI got big stacks comin' out the safe\nI got Lil Max with me, he the wave\nIt's a big gap between us in the game\nIn the next life, I'm tryna stay paid\nWhen I die, put my money in the grave\nWhen I die, put my money in the grave\nI really gotta put a couple niggas in they place\nReally just lapped every nigga in the race\nI really might tat \"Realest Nigga\" on my face\nLil CC let it slap with the bass\nI used to save hoes with a mask and a cape\nNow I'm like, \"Nah, love, I'm good, go away\"\nAin't about to die with no money, I done gave it\nI was on top when that shit meant a lot\nStill on top like I'm scared of the drop\nStill on top and these niggas wanna swap\nNiggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts\nI don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at\nMob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at\nWord to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J\nTell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave\nWhen I die, put my money in the grave\nI really gotta put a couple niggas in they place\nReally just lapped every nigga in the race\nI really might tat \"Realest Nigga\" on my face\nLil CC let it slap with the bass\nI used to save hoes with a mask and a cape\nNow I'm like, \"Nah, love, I'm good, go away\"\nAin't about to die with no money, I done gave
