I rep the East with my trustees\nSmokin' on\u2005crushed\u2005leaves\nThey turn they\u2005back on everything we built, then\u2005they must bleed\nI've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze\nStraps over territory they know we must keep\nGet home and white Air Forces get brushed clean\nBack when my mama would interrupt sleep\nTo tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves\nSummertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves\nMy shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys\nI can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?\nNiggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas\nI'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy\nAnd the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy\nIt's on Meech like it's trendy\nRunnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah\nEarly twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies\nI need plenty\nGot me ready to flip the F out like Fendi\nWhatever's in me, it's takin' over\nI gotta bust it down, break it open\nUntil somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\nLook\nBack when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing\nBack when the house that I own now was my home screen\nBefore I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team\nRunnin' missions\nPyramid schemes just like the Egyptians\nBack when hotlines were still flippin'\nNow I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different\nTransitions, plans switchin', ambition\nMindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera\nInspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla\nI always had a little somethin' extra\nBack when Corey was our sole investor\nAnd the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya\nLook, I ain't no baller\nStill need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller\nMy soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers\nAnd easin' tensions\nKeepin' family out of East Detention\nAnd out of Pine Hill Funeral Center\nSpots we got no business enterin'\nBack when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye\nI had to find a way to get someone's attention\nThen we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\nYeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'\nDeep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in\nNow we rollin'\n\n"}, {"title": "When To Say When", "year": "2020",
