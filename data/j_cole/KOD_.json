you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through\nI know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through\nI put my hand to the sky, I sing\nGrateful for the blessings you bring\nThank you for the ones I love\nForgive me for the times I was\nDown and confused, I know\nWhat I reap is what I will sow\nOnce again I find myself\nBack with you from my hell\nAll I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back\nGet some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that\nAll I wanna do is see my granny on the other side\nAll I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry\nAll I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate\nAll I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape\nAll I wanna do is see my granny on the other side\nAll I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry\nIt's not that big\nWell at least, um\nGod had saved him 'cause he still alive\nSo why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?\nLike why can't the world just be all nice things?\nBecause God is tryna, um\nWarn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn\nOr He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world\nHe's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time\nAnd after we do that, He's gonna restart the world\nK.O.D\nChoose wisely!\n\n"}, {"title": "1985", "year": "2018", "album": "KOD ", "writers": ["j. cole", "j cole"], "artist": "j cole", "lyrics": ""}]
