shitless, there goes two of my wishes\nForever scarred, determined to get some heart\nNo matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are\nFast forward to our older years, two different paths\nYou used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last\nWasted potential, getting cash, what could I say?\nSo tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold\nYour demise, one day much to my surprise\nMy nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size\nI asked if it was self-defense, he said it was defense of pride\nAnd that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn\nNot my nigga, the same one that told me\nThat things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga\nThe news call him a killer, but he my nigga\nSad shit, aye yo, genie last wish, free my nigga\n\n"}]
