I'm a Wright Brother\nWent away to school looking for the right lover\nYou know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber\nShe had a man, I be damned, think I might love her\nThought about her ass for the whole damn Summer\nMan I even memorized her whole damn number\nThis is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her\nY'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him\nOh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog\nSo it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now\nI wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?\nThe dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now\nDo that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?\nBaby girl, roll down the window\nI love to see your hair float when the wind blow\nEven if the money been slow\nAyy, to you it don't

touch but you never left my imagination\nCongratulations on your graduation\nOh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and applications\nMan, but ain't nobody calling you back\nYou say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that\nThe weight of everything on your plate\nYou got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you\n'Ey has this world got too real for you?\nYour old friends say you changed but I still know you\nYou that same old girl I used to take home from school\nTryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn\nTime passed and you done grew up\nAnd yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up\nBut the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me\nSo holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me\nBaby girl, roll down the window\nI love to see your hair float when the wind blow\nEven if the money been slow\nAyy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon'
