nothing\nAin't no way I'm leaving out of here with nothing\nAin't no playing fair I got to take it from em'\nAlmost lost my life, 2016\nNiggas switch teams, niggas did things\nOoo I can't let em' catch me slippin'\nNo I can't let em' catch me slippin', wait\nI got hatters now I'm doing something different\nThey bump my shit whatever area you live in\nThey don't wanna see me rental car with it\nThey don't wanna see me lay up but I'm living, wait\nBecause I always feel like running, not away because there's no such place\nBecause if there was I would've found it by now\nBecause it's easier to run\nEasier then staying and finding out, you're the only one who didn't run\n\n"}, {"title": "Darkside", "year": "2017", "album": "Essentials, Vol. 1 ", "writers": ["quentin miller"],
